			<p class="results-text">Bloomberg Philanthropies has tested the Innovation Delivery approach with i-teams in five cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Louisville, Memphis, and New Orleans. The results have been strong. In New Orleans, the i-team helped the city reduce its murder rate by 19% in less than two years. In just sixteen months, Memphis’ i-team leveraged the approach to fill 53% of the empty storefronts in key commercial tracts of the city, giving hope to small business owners and reinvigorating the city’s core. Innovation Teams in pioneer cities have decreased homelessness, reduced youth violence, and stimulated economic growth—applying Innovation Delivery to develop and deliver bold new solutions to previously intractable problems. The mayors of all five pioneer cities have seen the value of Innovation Delivery and are investing public dollars to sustain their i-teams when their grants end.</p>
			<p class="results-text">Based on the success of the pioneer cities, and growing demand from mayors around the country and around the world, in December 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced a significant expansion of the i-teams program, Twelve U.S. cities were selected to participate in the $45 million expansion: Albuquerque, NM; Boston, MA; Centennial, CO; Jersey City, NJ; Long Beach, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Mobile, AL; Minneapolis, MN; Peoria, IL; Rochester, NY; Seattle, WA; and Syracuse, NY. Two non-U.S. cities also joined the program: Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel were also selected to participate. Funding will allow mayors in each of these cities to create dedicated i-teams to develop and deliver bold new approaches to issues such as affordable housing, public safety, infrastructure finance, customer service, and job growth.</p>
