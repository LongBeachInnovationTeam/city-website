		<h3>LONG BEACH INNOVATION TEAM</h3>
		<p>The Innovation Team (i-team) was launched in May of 2015 by Mayor Robert Garcia and City Manager Pat West to collaboratively create sustainable solutions for the city's greatest challenges.</p>
		<p>The i-team extends the City's capacity to rapidly advance research and development through a bold, data-driven, and transparent approach to innovation. Co-created solutions will improve the lives of all who call Long Beach their home.</p>
		<p>The team is generously supported by Long Beach City Council and Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br /><br />The i-team is currently focused on identifying economic development opportunities that will stimulate new investment, create jobs, strengthen our workforce, and improve the city's business friendliness.
