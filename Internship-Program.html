			<p>Interns have the unique opportunity to work side by side an interdisciplinary team which includes a designer, researcher, developer, and project managers. The Long Beach i-team is committed to breaking down barriers to innovation in city government and work to address complicated and long standing problems such as economic development and access to city services. Interns have the opportunity to learn the Bloomberg Innovation methodology, user-centered design, get a taste for the changing face of local government, strengthen their qualitative skills, and make a real difference in the Long Beach community.</p>
