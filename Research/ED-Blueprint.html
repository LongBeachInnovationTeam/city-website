                <h2>Economic Development Blueprint</h2>
                <p>In 2015, the Mayor and City Council requested the City’s Economic Development Commission, with the assistance of staff, to prepare an Economic Development Blueprint (Blueprint) to define priorities that will lead to creation of businesses, well-paying jobs, and increase the standards of living for our diverse residents.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the Blueprint is to identify economic opportunities and challenges to provide a catalyst for economic activity across the city, in key growth sectors and sub-regions to foster investment, business development and job opportunities. This will involve a number of recommendations about how the City and local partners can maximize economic assets, resources and services to grow economic activity; implement new technologies to improve services and opportunities for citizens; and partner with the private sector to become a center for innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>

                <h3>Economic Development Support Analysis</h3>
                <p>In September 2015, the City of Long Beach commissioned Beacon Economics, LLC with developing a report that would facilitate a more focused dialogue about economic conditions within the City.</p>
                <p>The goal of the report is to provide timely quantitative indicators for the City of Long Beach. The report provides essential background information on the City’s economy, its workforce, and its residents that may serve as a reference as the City undertakes strategic economic and policy decisions that will help shape the future of the City. Moreover, it contains metrics that can be used to establish economic development, workforce, and other goals, and track progress toward those goals.</p>
