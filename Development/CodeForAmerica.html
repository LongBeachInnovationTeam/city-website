				The City of Long Beach in partnership with Code for America’s Fellowship program will be developing online tools to help entrepreneurs easily navigate the steps to start, manage, and grow a business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, a prospective small business owner in Long Beach must navigate multiple agencies, departments, and forms to find information on the registration, licensing, and financing process. The Fellowship will create a web application that connects entrepreneurs to business planning resources so they can easily and successfully navigate the registration process.

					We’re excited to collaborate – once again – with Code for America to continue making Long Beach more efficient, transparent, and innovative. This year, we're pleased to use technology to increase inclusive engagement of our business community and streamline the way businesses interact with the City digitally. Working with Code for America will have a lasting impact on not only our community, but will further support the way we work to build 21st Century government practices within the walls of City Hall.

			<p>
				The Code for America Fellowship program pairs local governments with teams of mid-career, civic-minded technologists for one year, to develop digital approaches to delivering public services, such as improving access to health and human services; reducing incarceration; or promoting economic development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fellows and governments partners will explore answers to local challenges by engaging with the community, building applications, and testing the results. Over the past five years, the Fellowship program has produced more than 65 software applications with 38 municipal governments and 126 fellows.
